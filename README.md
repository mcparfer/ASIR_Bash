This project contains a script to manage the execution of a service named "servicio.prueba" located in the directory /etc. It includes a configuration file called "servicio.prueba.conf" in the same directory. The script supports operations such as starting, stopping, checking status, and reloading the service, and logs the operations with timestamps to a specified file. Proper error handling is implemented for various scenarios.
